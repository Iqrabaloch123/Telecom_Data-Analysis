Revenue Boost: 5G launch has significantly increased revenue, driven by customer acquisition and plan upgrades.
ARPU Concern: Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) is below target, needing strategic improvement.
Top Plans: Premium and unlimited 5G plans are highly successful, reflecting strong customer interest.
Mid-Tier Plans: Some mid-tier plans underperform, requiring reassessment and possible revision.
5G Starter Plan: Underperformance suggests potential discontinuation to optimize the portfolio.
4G Plan Discontinued: The 4G Basic Plan has been discontinued due to the shift towards 5G.
This analysis highlights necessary strategic adjustments to enhance performance and optimize plan offerings.
